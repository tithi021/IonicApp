# Cordova - what and why?

	-- Javascript API that "wraps" native app
		- Cordova, which was formally knows as PhoneGap, provides a javascript API that wraps native API such as the camera or geo location on the actual mobile device. Cordova is cross-platform. So, regardless of whether you're on android, ios or windows, cordova will ensure that you can write the code with a consistent API that can be reused everywhere.

	-- Native mobile apps using HTML/JS/CSS
		- Cordova enables you to build mobile apps that are natively installed via the app strore on each respected platform. So the apps are physically installed on the device just like every other native app. The defferences is cordova allows you to built these apps with HTML5,Javascript and css.

	-- Re-use existing web skill
		- Since cordova enables developers to use HTML and Javascript, this means we can reuse our existing web skills. 

	-- Re-use existing web framework
		- Not only can we leverage existing web skills but also existing web framework. There is no better example than the ionic framework is built on top of angularjs.All of your existing angualarjs knowledge will transfer when using the ionic framework in a cordova app.
